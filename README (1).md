This project aims to estimate salaries for various job roles in the tech industry—such as Data Scientists, Software Engineers, and Product Managers—by leveraging machine learning techniques. Data was collected from job platforms like Glassdoor and Indeed, then cleaned and transformed for analysis. Using features like job title, location, company type, and rating, the model provides accurate salary predictions. The final solution includes a Streamlit web app allowing users to input job details and receive real-time salary estimates.
